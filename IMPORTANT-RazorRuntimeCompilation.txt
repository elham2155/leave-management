IMPORTANT - Razor Runtime Compilation

Add Razor Runtime Compilation

In this course we will be doing a bit of UI work and refreshing. 
You will need to recompile every time a change is made and I 
demonstrate how to do this more easily using Browser Link, but this 
works for some people and not for others.

ASP.Net Core now comes with Razor Runtime Compilation which you can 
enable when creating the project (which wasn't supported fully at 
the time) or following these simple steps:

1. Install the :
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation (NuGet package)

2. Add the line :
services.AddRazorPages().AddRazorRuntimeCompilation(); 
to the project's Startup.cs file and the ConfigureServices() methodto 
include a call to AddRazorRuntimeCompilation.

Scoped vs Singleton vs Transient

Scoped

Scoped lifetime services  are created once per client request (connection).


Transient

Transient lifetime services are created each time they're requested from the service container. 
This lifetime works best for lightweight, stateless services.


Singleton

Singleton lifetime services are created the first time they're requested 
(or when Startup.ConfigureServices is run and an instance is specified with the service 
registration). Every subsequent request uses the same instance. If the app requires singleton 
behavior, allowing the service container to manage the service's lifetime is recommended. 
Don't implement the singleton design pattern and provide user code to manage the object's 
lifetime in the class.
